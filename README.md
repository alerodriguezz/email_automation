# email_automation
Python program that sends emails using smtplib. 

It reads two html contents from a file and distributes the file to the list of email_clients given. At this moment it only sends the email to one user but a loop can be added to send to more users. 

It uses gmail as the host but can be configured to any mail hosting service.
